Documenting projects following following the nand2tetris course.

Completed (almost) up to Project 09. Project 08 has a bug that causes it to fail the last test. I'm not sure exactly where the bug is. After comparing it to other people's code, it seems like the ASM language is correct. It feels like I must be fundamentally misunderstanding something in the assignment. Since the next project is to learn the Jack language, I figured I'd take a break from nand2tetris for a bit and try to learn the Odin Language. That is currently what I am doing. After I feel like I have a good grasp on that language, I will come back to correct my bug(s) and move on with the assignment. Ultimately, I hope to build a compiler in Odin before coming back. This will also follow courses 10 and 11, but just substitute Odin for Jack. I did watch the remaining videos for all courses on coursera.org.
